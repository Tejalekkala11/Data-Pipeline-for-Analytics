		Set the batch size (e.g., 100).

		Click "Add".

	3.Write Lambda Function Code:

		In the Lambda function code editor, write a function to process the incoming data. For example:
		use the code with file name "lambda-function-editor.py" 

	4.Deploy the Lambda Function:

		Click "Deploy" to save and deploy your Lambda function.

Step 3: Set Up AWS Glue for Data Transformation
	1.Create a Glue Database:

		Choose the data source (e.g., S3 bucket where your data is stored).

		Choose the IAM role for the crawler.

		Set the frequency (e.g., run on demand).

		Choose the database you created earlier (my-glue-database).

		Click "Finish".

	3.Run the Glue Crawler:

		Select your crawler and click "Run crawler".

		This will create a table in your Glue database.

	4.Create a Glue Job:

		In the Glue Console, click "Jobs" in the left sidebar.

		Click "Add job".

		Enter a name for your job, e.g., my-glue-job.

		Choose the IAM role for the job.

		Choose "Spark" as the type.

		Choose "Python" as the language.

		Enter the script path (e.g., s3://my-bucket/glue-job.py).

		Click "Save job and edit script".

	5.Edit the Glue Job Script:

		Use the provided glue-job.py script:

		run glue-job.py
	
	6.Run the Glue Job:

		In the Glue Console, select your job and click "Run job".

Step 4: Query Data Using Athena
	1.Set Up Athena:

		Go to the Athena Console.

		Choose the database you created earlier (my-glue-database).

	2.Write a SQL query to analyze your data, e.g.:
		
		Run the file sql-command.sql.

		Click "Run query" to see the results.

Step 5: Visualize Data Using QuickSight

	1.Set Up QuickSight:

		Go to the QuickSight Console.

		Sign up for QuickSight if you haven't already.

	2.Create a Dataset:

		In QuickSight, click "New dataset".

		Choose "Athena" as the data source.

		Enter a name for your data source, e.g., my-athena-datasource.

		Choose the database and table you created earlier.

		Click "Create data source".

	3.Create an Analysis:

		In QuickSight, click "New analysis".

		Choose the dataset you created.

		Use the visualizations tools to create charts and dashboards.

	4.Publish the Dashboard:

		Once your analysis is complete, click "Publish dashboard".
